         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Living God of Heaven and Earth whom all people ought to Reverence and Worſhip (with all humility) in Spirit and truth in their hearts, hath waited long to be gracious unto you, and hath done great things for you; he hath given you life and breath, ſtrength and health, and fulneſs, and plenty, of all good things, more hath not been in any age as in this latter age; beſides all theſe outward Bleſſings and mercies manifeſted from God unto you; he hath alſo held forth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in much love and kindneſs unto you, in giving his Son a Light into the World, that hath enlightened your underſtandings, and ſhewed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you what is good, and what is evil; and he hath long been ſtriving with you inwardly by his Light and Spirit to draw your hearts out of the evil, into the good; that you might walk with him, and live unto him in the life that is pure and holy; and moreover (as the overflowings of his love, and to manifeſt his willingneſs that all might be ſaved, and none periſh) he hath ſent forth his Meſſengers and ſervants amongſt you, to invite you to come unto him and wait upon him, and ſerve and obey him in truth and uprightneſs of heart; and much more hath the Lord done for you, whereby you are for ever left without excuſe. All which Mercies have been abuſed by many of you, and the proffers &amp; tenders of Love ſleighted, and you have kicked againſt God, and have not turned at his reproofes; but have caſt his Law behind your backs, and turned his Grace into wantonneſs; you have lived in pride and pleaſures, and have delighted (and taken pleaſure more) in the Creatures, then in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: Oh the ſins, the ſins of the people of this City are great, drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whoredom, luxury, rioting and exceſs, and all manner of abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations are found within your borders; and when you have been warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Servants of God in the day of your Proſperity, of the calamity and miſery that was coming upon you, and the Plagues and Judgments that did hang over your heads, (as many have been faithful in warning of you) you have made a light matter of it, and eſteemed the many warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as a thing of nought; and deſpiſed the Meſſengers and Servants of God, and evilly entreating of them by reviling, and ſcoffing, and caſting them into naſty Priſons, as in theſe late years paſt hath been largly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt.
